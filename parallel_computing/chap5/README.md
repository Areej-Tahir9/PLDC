# **Chapter 5: Asynchronous Programming in Python**

This directory contains Python scripts demonstrating various concepts in asynchronous programming using the `asyncio` library and the `concurrent.futures` module. Asynchronous programming allows you to write concurrent code that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking the main program's execution.

## **Contents**

* **asyncioAndFuture.py:**
    - Demonstrates how to combine `asyncio` with `concurrent.futures` to leverage the benefits of both approaches.
    - Shows how to execute synchronous functions within an `asyncio` event loop using `ThreadPoolExecutor` or `ProcessPoolExecutor` from `concurrent.futures`.
    - Example: Offloading CPU-bound tasks to a thread pool while keeping I/O operations asynchronous.

* **asyncioCoRoutine.py:**
    - Illustrates the use of coroutines and the `async`/`await` syntax in `asyncio`.
    - Shows how to define asynchronous functions using `async def` and how to await the results of other coroutines.
    - Example: Making asynchronous HTTP requests using `aiohttp` library.

* **asyncioEventLoop.py:**
    - Shows how to create and manage the `asyncio` event loop.
    - Explains the role of the event loop in scheduling and executing coroutines.
    - Demonstrates how to run tasks within the event loop using `asyncio.run()`.

* **asyncioTaskManipulation.py:**
    - Demonstrates how to create, schedule, and manipulate tasks in the `asyncio` event loop.
    - Shows how to create tasks using `asyncio.create_task()`, cancel tasks, and wait for tasks to complete.
    - Example: Implementing a simple task scheduler that executes tasks in a specific order.

* **concurrent_Futures_pooling.py:**
    - Shows how to use the `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `ProcessPoolExecutor` from `concurrent.futures` for efficient parallel execution.
    - Explains the differences between thread-based and process-based parallelism.
    - Example: Parallelizing a computationally intensive task using a thread pool.

## **Getting Started**

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python installed.

2.  **Clone the repository:** If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine.

3.  **Run the scripts:** Execute the desired script using the Python interpreter:

    ```bash
    python asyncioCoRoutine.py
    ```

## **Usage**

Each script has its own specific functionality. Please refer to the individual script files for detailed usage instructions, examples, and comments within the code for better understanding.
