## **Files and Descriptions**

### **1. `access_resource.py`**  
- **Purpose**:  
  Demonstrates accessing shared resources in a concurrent environment.  
- **Usage**:  
  Use this script to understand how Python handles resource access in multithreaded or multiprocessing setups.  

---

### **2. `fibonacci.py`**  
- **Purpose**:  
  Implements an algorithm to calculate Fibonacci sequences using various approaches, including recursion and iterative methods.  
- **Usage**:  
  Run this file to see efficient implementations of Fibonacci calculations.  

---

### **3. `mpi.py`**  
- **Purpose**:  
  Explores the use of MPI (Message Passing Interface) for parallel programming in Python.  
- **Usage**:  
  Designed for use in distributed computing environments; ensure an MPI framework is installed.  

---

### **4. `multiprocessing.py`**  
- **Purpose**:  
  Demonstrates the use of Python's multiprocessing module for parallel execution of tasks.  
- **Usage**:  
  Use this script to learn about process-based parallelism and how to distribute workloads effectively.  

---

### **5. `multiThreading.py`**  
- **Purpose**:  
  Covers the basics of multithreading in Python and demonstrates its applications.  
- **Usage**:  
  Use this to understand thread-based parallelism and thread management.  

---

### **6. `numba.py`**  
- **Purpose**:  
  Showcases the use of the Numba library to optimize Python code for high-performance numerical computations.  
- **Usage**:  
  Run this script to see how Numba can speed up numerical tasks using just-in-time (JIT) compilation.  

---

### **7. `process_pipe.py`**  
- **Purpose**:  
  Demonstrates inter-process communication using pipes in Python.  
- **Usage**:  
  Use this to learn about sending and receiving data between processes effectively.
